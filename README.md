# Getting Started

### Run server

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/ajdroid270/node-socket-test) and run it on port 5000.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000/chat/:convId](http://localhost:3000/chat/0) to create & join the conversation with id `convId`. Open a different tab/window/browser with the same `convId` to exchange real-time messages.

You can use any random string as `convId` to create/join a conversation.
